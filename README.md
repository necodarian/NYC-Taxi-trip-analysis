# Taxi_trip_analysis
### Introduction:
Cab Taxi is a thriving transportation business in many parts of the world. It
facilitates easy movement of people, goods, and services from one location to
another. The aim of this data analysis task is to analyse the Yellow Medallion
Taxicabs dataset: the famous New York City (NYC) yellow taxis that provide
transportation exclusively through street hails (i.e., the pickups are not prearranged). Passengers stand by the street and hail on an available taxi with
their hand. In this analysis, you will answer some business questions and
perform regression analysis to predict the total amount paid by the
passengers after a given trip.
Data:
The dataset was sourced from the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC)
official website. The dataset contains several explanatory variables used to
assess a completed trip such as pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and
drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types,
and driver-reported passenger counts. You can find the complete description
of the dataset on the course page. A subsample of the original data is
provided for you to use for the tasks itemised in the following sections. The
trip records are divided into two files Main Sample and New Sample,
respectively.
